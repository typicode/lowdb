## Purpose

This license gives everyone patronizing contributors to this software permission to ignore any noncommercial or copyleft rules of its free public license, while continuing to protect contributors from liability.

## Acceptance

In order to agree to these terms and receive a license, you must qualify under [Patrons](#patrons).  The rules of these terms are both obligations under your agreement and conditions to your license.  That agreement and your license continue only while you qualify as a patron.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

## Patrons

To accept these terms, you must be enrolled to make regular payments through any of the payment platforms pages listed above, in amounts qualifying you for a tier that includes a "patron license" or otherwise identifies a license under these terms as a reward.

## Scope

Except under [Seat](#seat) and [Applications](#applications), you may not sublicense or transfer any agreement or license under these terms to anyone else.

## Seat

If a legal entity, rather than an individual, accepts these terms, the entity may sublicense one individual employee or independent contractor at any given time.  If the employee or contractor breaks any rule of these terms, the entity will stand directly responsible.

## Applications

If you combine this software with other software in a larger application, you may sublicense this software as part of your larger application, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under these rules:

1.  Your larger application must have significant additional content or functionality beyond that of this software, and end users must license your larger application primarily for that added content or functionality.

2.  You may not sublicense anyone to break any rule of the public license for this software for any changes of their own or any software besides your larger application.

3.  You may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as you like.

## Copyright

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

## Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the texts of both this license and the free public license for this software.

## Excuse

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with [Notices](#notices), you can keep your agreement and your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your agreement under these terms ends immediately, and your license ends with it.

## Patent

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

## Reliability

No contributor can revoke this license, but your license may end if you break any rule of these terms.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
